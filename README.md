# sit_on_chair
Webpage that sells chairs. 

There is information about products and available plans, calculator that can be used to calculate prices of a particular chair, and form that allows to contact a company.

**Basic functionality** is added with JavaScript. For example, on smaller screens, menu is shown as a hamburger, and when a user clicks on it modal appears. There is a dropdown menu that expands/hides on clicking.

The webpage is still **in working progress**, as some functionality features should be added. In particular, webpage should be responsive (written with the help of CSS flexbox). For now, only half of the webpage if responsive.
